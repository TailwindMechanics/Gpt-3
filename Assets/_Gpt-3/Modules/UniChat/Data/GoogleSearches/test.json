"The IJobChunk approach in Unity DOTS has been replaced by the IJobEntityBatch approach as of version 0.17.0 (2020-11-13). This change provides performance improvements due to the new job type's lower scheduling overhead. It is recommended that users update their projects to use the new IJobEntityBatch approach for better performance."
