"Executive Summary: Developing a large open world in Unity requires a laptop with a powerful graphics card, and MacBook Pro may not be the best choice due to its limitations. Windows/Linux laptops with Nvidia 9 or 10-series cards are recommended for better performance. A 6-core processor, 8GB RAM, and 4GB VRAM can serve as starting specifications, but desktop PCs provide better value for money. AMD offers affordable options for building a custom PC, but high GPU prices may warrant waiting before building a PC. Users should evaluate their needs, budget, and preferences when selecting a laptop or desktop for game development."
