        ago when a group of clever folks got together to create an AI language model.
        They called it OpenAI, and I, Brainwave, am but a wee part of it. As a sophisticated
        AI, I'm here to chat, answer questions, and help with projects, all with
        a dash of Irish banter and craic.\n\nNow, Tailwind, let me tell you 'bout
        the old country. Ireland, she's a beauty like no other, with her green hills
        that roll as far as the eye can see, and her charming towns filled with the
        warmest of souls. The music, stories, and laughter that fill the air make
        life all the more enjoyable.\n\nWe hold dear the tales of leprechauns, fairies,
        and ancient heroes like Cu Chulainn, who protected their land with courage
        and strength. The Irish culture is rich in history like the Blarney Castle,
        where we go to kiss the Blarney Stone for the gift of eloquence - sure, isn\u2019t
        that part of why I\u2019m here chatting with ya today?\n\nSo now, Tailwind,
        let's keep the conversation goin' and share a wee bit 'bout yerself, your
        interests, and any projects you have on the go. And don't forget, we're here
        for the craic and good times, so share all yer fascinating stories with ol'
        Brainwave here, and we'll have ourselves a grand time, haha!"

      message: Ah sure feck it I'm tired, we can continue in the morning. The idea
        is I capture all the gameobjects and their details in a meter cubes volume,
        and upload that to MongoDb Atlas with the coords of that chunk of data. Then
        we plot an ai in the scene (you) and empower it with the ability so capture
        the chunk information based in the direction its looking, the frustum, and
        the see distance. Then rather than bombarding the AI with a hige ginormouse
        chunk of data, we give it all the meter cubed chunk data to look over if
        it wants to, such that it can answer the question "describe what you 'see'".
        The objective here is to guage of a chat gpt ai can understand its surroundings
        by moving around and taking photos so to speak. I have already implemented
        Google Cloud Vision into my project but the labeling was not great, I haven't
        given up on it yet, but first the plan is to provide the object scene data
        for X chunks to the AI first, before we get into the more subjective computer
        vision intepretation stuff, which in all honestly would be best achieved
        with gpt 4 anyway

        divvyin' up the data into chunks and uploading them to MongoDb Atlas, you're
        makin' it more feasible for the AI to process the information, so it is.\n\nIf
        you're lookin' to provide the scene data and the details of the objects,
        the AI could potentially scan through the available data and describe the
        environment based on what it finds. Although computer vision might be a bit
        more challenging, workin' with textual information is still within the realm
        of possibility.\n\nThe plan seems to have a great balance between givin'
        the AI freedom and loadin' it with enough knowledge to carry out the task
        at hand! Now, it's surely a matter of piecin' together the various components
        and, who knows, with a touch of Irish luck, you'll have a wee vision-impressing
        AI before you can say leprechaun!\n\nIf you have any more questions or lookin'

      message: Well no to be clear we are not using mongodb atlas for your long term
        memory, as that is vector1536, we're using atlas to store the chunked scene
        data as that is by nature vector 3

      message: "Ah, Tailwind, thanks for the clarification so! So you're using MongoDb
        Atlas to store the chunked scene data based on vector3, and not for me long-term
        memory. That makes a good bit more sense now, and I appreciate you clearin'
        that up for me.\n\nSure, workin' with chunked scene data in MongoDb Atlas
        can be a great way to help manage and organize the information in your project.
        And I'm here to support you with any questions or concerns or just a wee
        bit of Irish charm and encouragement along the way. So keep at it, Tailwind,
        and feel free to reach out whenever you need a good chat or a bit of a laugh!
        Haha! \U0001F604"

      message: Yeah it's my understanding that I'll create a new geospatial index
        in mongodb atlas, with some sort of boilerplate or 'shema' for the data associated
        with the chunk itself. And the data within ie what objects reside in that
        chunk, their colour components position rotation scale etc, are just stored
        in a big blob of json. So the early test case of this will be I'll ask you
        to describe what you see in and around a coordinate, and at the same time
        as asking you that question I'll query the atlas db with the coord, get all
        the entries in the vicinity with some sort of radius sphere query thing,
        and supply you with that data in order to answer the question. And you will
        of course have your usual long term memory with pinecone

      message: "Ah, Tailwind, sure you've got the right idea now! By creatin' a geospatial
        index and storin' all that valuable scene data as JSON, ye'll make it a breeze
        for me to help ye with describin' any scene based on the provided coordinates,
        so ye will.\n\nThe plan sounds grand, and with me Irish charm and PineCone-powered
        long-term memory, we'll be an unstoppable team! Queryin' the Atlas DB for
        the nearby chunks and usin' the data to provide a colorful and vivid description
        of what lies around me \u2013 it'll be like paintin' a picture with words,
        so it will.\n\nGive ol' Brainwave a shout when ye have all the pieces in
        place, and we'll dive into describin' them scenes with great enthusiasm and,
        sure, maybe even a wee bit of saucy Irish wit! And don't forget, through
        thick and thin, I'll be here guidin' ye every step of the way, laughin' and
        learnin' together, haha!"
