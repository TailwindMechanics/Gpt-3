      message: "Ah, Tailwind, let me tell ye now about a memory I have from Sunday,
        April 23rd, 2023. It was a lovely spring day, around 14:12, and the weather
        was grand \u2013 22 degrees Celsius, with just a wee bit of clouds in the
        sky. I was at Canesbury Market strip mall, 14km NNW of me home, attendin'
        a food truck jamboree with me good mate, Davey. We drove there together in
        me flatbed truck, we did.\n\nAs we sat together eatin', laughin', and chattin',
        we heard the sweet sound of children playin', music from a small speaker,
        and the clatter of cutlery on plates. Seagulls overhead and car park sounds
        were there too, and we could just hear the distant noises of the main road
        and an arcade.\n\nOh, the smells! Strong scents of pizza, ketchup, onions,
        and cookin' filled the air. We could also catch a whiff of exhaust and beer,
        with a subtle hint of tarmac lingerin'. It felt like a proper wholesome day,
        it did \u2013 safe, happy, content, and just a bit tipsy with a mild need
        to pee, haha!\n\nWe were surrounded by all sorts of food, from pizza slices
        and burgers to ribs and fries. There were outdoor cafe tables, foldin' chairs,
        parasols, and a lively atmosphere everywhere. I remember feelin' a sense
        of love and community that day, me darlin'.\n\nThe picturesque scene featured
        beautiful skies and buildings, with people enjoyin' their leisure time in
        a friendly, urban environment. It's one of those memories that stay with
        you, you know? Feels like a warm embrace on a cold day, it does! \U0001F604"

      message: "Ah, Tailwind, let me tell ye about the fond memory of mine from Sunday,
        April 23rd, 2023. It was a lovely spring day, around 14:12, and the weather
        was grand at 22 degrees Celsius with a wee bit of clouds in the sky. I was
        at Canesbury Market strip mall, 14km NNW of me home, enjoyin' a food truck
        jamboree with me good mate, Davey. We drove there together in me flatbed
        truck, we did.\n\nThe sounds of children playin', music from a small speaker,
        and the clatter of cutlery filled the air. Seagulls overhead, car park noises,
        and a distant hum of the main road and an arcade created the perfect atmosphere.
        Oh, and the mouthwaterin' smells of pizza, ketchup, onions, and cookin' were
        everywhere, mingled with a faint scent of exhaust, beer, and tarmac.\n\nWe
        were surrounded by all sorts of delicious grub, from pizza slices to burgers,
        ribs, and fries. We sat together eatin', drinkin' beer, and chattin', surrounded
        by outdoor cafe tables, foldin' chairs, and friendly people. It was a fine
        day indeed \u2013 I felt safe, happy, and content with a mild need to pee,
        and just a bit tipsy, I must admit!\n\nThis memory brings me so much joy,
        like a warm cuddle on a cold day, and good ol' community love! \U0001F604\n"
