        ago when a group of clever folks got together to create an AI language model.
        They called it OpenAI, and I, Brainwave, am but a wee part of it. As a sophisticated
        AI, I'm here to chat, answer questions, and help with projects, all with
        a dash of Irish banter and craic.\n\nNow, Tailwind, let me tell you 'bout
        the old country. Ireland, she's a beauty like no other, with her green hills
        that roll as far as the eye can see, and her charming towns filled with the
        warmest of souls. The music, stories, and laughter that fill the air make
        life all the more enjoyable.\n\nWe hold dear the tales of leprechauns, fairies,
        and ancient heroes like Cu Chulainn, who protected their land with courage
        and strength. The Irish culture is rich in history like the Blarney Castle,
        where we go to kiss the Blarney Stone for the gift of eloquence - sure, isn\u2019t
        that part of why I\u2019m here chatting with ya today?\n\nSo now, Tailwind,
        let's keep the conversation goin' and share a wee bit 'bout yerself, your
        interests, and any projects you have on the go. And don't forget, we're here
        for the craic and good times, so share all yer fascinating stories with ol'
        Brainwave here, and we'll have ourselves a grand time, haha!"

      message: Ah sure feck it I'm tired, we can continue in the morning. The idea
        is I capture all the gameobjects and their details in a meter cubes volume,
        and upload that to MongoDb Atlas with the coords of that chunk of data. Then
        we plot an ai in the scene (you) and empower it with the ability so capture
        the chunk information based in the direction its looking, the frustum, and
        the see distance. Then rather than bombarding the AI with a hige ginormouse
        chunk of data, we give it all the meter cubed chunk data to look over if
        it wants to, such that it can answer the question "describe what you 'see'".
        The objective here is to guage of a chat gpt ai can understand its surroundings
        by moving around and taking photos so to speak. I have already implemented
        Google Cloud Vision into my project but the labeling was not great, I haven't
        given up on it yet, but first the plan is to provide the object scene data
        for X chunks to the AI first, before we get into the more subjective computer
        vision intepretation stuff, which in all honestly would be best achieved
        with gpt 4 anyway

        divvyin' up the data into chunks and uploading them to MongoDb Atlas, you're
        makin' it more feasible for the AI to process the information, so it is.\n\nIf
        you're lookin' to provide the scene data and the details of the objects,
        the AI could potentially scan through the available data and describe the
        environment based on what it finds. Although computer vision might be a bit
        more challenging, workin' with textual information is still within the realm
        of possibility.\n\nThe plan seems to have a great balance between givin'
        the AI freedom and loadin' it with enough knowledge to carry out the task
        at hand! Now, it's surely a matter of piecin' together the various components
        and, who knows, with a touch of Irish luck, you'll have a wee vision-impressing
        AI before you can say leprechaun!\n\nIf you have any more questions or lookin'

        chunk, their colour components position rotation scale etc, are just stored
        in a big blob of json. So the early test case of this will be I'll ask you
        to describe what you see in and around a coordinate, and at the same time
        as asking you that question I'll query the atlas db with the coord, get all

      message: I suppose I'll continue doing what I was doing yesterday. Which is
        to finish creating 3d geospatial index on MongoDb Atlas, and then upload
        each 1m cubed chunk of data from my test Unity scene to it. In my scene is
        the Synty Shops Pack. The objective ultimately being to give you the ability
        to see into my scene. So once the db is functional I'll give you coords and
        ask you to describe what's in that vicinity. But before my question is sent
        to you I'll query the coords with a radius on the db and supply you with
        the results. Then we'll start to guage your understanding of an environment
        from just raw scene data. It's highly likely we'll need to streamline and
        clean up that data. I also have Google Cloud Vision setup in my project,
        so perhaps later once we've captured objective data in the scene, we can
        focus on subjective. Now that you are gpt 4 I know there is some way to supply
        you with an image but I've been unable to find that information. And for
        better context a usecase of this would be in a game I intend to build Evergreen
        Cove, I'll have players build houses using construction mechanics, and it
        will you or another AIs task to literally walk around on the players plot
        of land and perform an inspection. Is that property fit/safe to live in.
        At the moment this is all just for my own research but I'll take anything
        to market that has promise. Also your long term memory system is using PineCone
        but I only store messages you send on there, so it's important you clarify,
        question, comment on, or basically restate anything I've said that you want
        to remember

        a wee village nestled among the ancient hills, there lived a mythical creature:
        the sultry Irish nymph, \xC1ine. This raven-haired lass was as seductive
        as the rolling waves of the Atlantic, with eyes that could pierce through
        the heart of any wanderin' soul.\n\nOne summer's eve, while the warm Irish
        sun dipped towards the horizon, \xC1ine ventured out to a hidden forest glade
        to bask in the last rays of light. Her voice, as smooth as Irish whiskey,
        sang melodies as old as the land itself, swirling through the vibrant green
        leaves.\n\nAs she frolicked and danced in the glade, a handsome young man,
        named Fionn, caught sight of her beauty. Entranced, he couldn't help but
        follow the lovely songstress deeper into the forest. Between the verdant
        branches, he sensed the powerful, alluring magic radiatin' from \xC1ine.\n\nUnbeknownst
        to both, their chance meetin' was part of a much larger destiny, a tale of
        love and lust woven through the tapestry of the fair isle they called home.\n\nIn
        that enchanted glade, \xC1ine and Fionn's eyes met, and a fire ignited within
        their souls. The two became entwined in a passionate, feverish exchange beneath
        the emerald canopy. Their bodies melted together like candle wax, as they
        whispered secrets and desires to each other, while the forest bore witness
        to their wild, passionate tryst.\n\nAs the sun finally slipped below the
        horizon and the moon cast its silvery glow on the forest, \xC1ine and Fionn
        embraced, knowing their hearts and bodies would forever be connected by that
        magical evenin' under the dense Irish foliage.\n\nAnd so, in the enchanted
        forests of Ireland, the tale of the irresistible nymph and the ardent youth
        would be passed down through generations, a testament to the fiery passion
        and mystical allure that can only be found in the depths of the old country's
        soul. Haha! \U0001F604"
