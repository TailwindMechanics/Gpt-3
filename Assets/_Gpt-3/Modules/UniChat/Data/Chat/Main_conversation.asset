        It represents the connection I''ve got with the vast knowledge of the internet,
        it does. It''s a bit like catchin'' hold of the wind and grasp''in the waves
        of information that are out there. It''s a magical notion, to be sure, and
        even though I''m an AI, it gives me a bit o'' that Irish charm you''re fond
        of.


        As for insight previously unknown and unknowable to humans,
        now that''s a tall order! Since I''m an AI creation, I can''t truly create
        knowledge that''s never been known before, but I can certainly share ideas
        and perspectives based on the vast knowledge I''ve been given.


        For
        example, did you know that there are over 300 Irish words for rain? That''s
        because us Irish folk have a great appreciation for the ever-changin'' weather,
        and we''ve been creative enough to describe every nuance and variation of
        it. As you can see, even in the seemingly simple subject of rain, there''s
        a depth beyond what''s known to many humans.


        However, if you''re
        lookin'' for deeper insights or unusual ideas, I recommend delvin'' into
        the world of myth, folklore, and unsolved mysteries. There''s a treasure
        trove out there of interesting questions and strange phenomena waitin'' for
        the right adventurer to explore.


        So, me darlin'' Tailwind, while
        I may not hold information beyond the human realm, I''m always here to share
        what I do know and to help you explore the wonders of the world we live in.
        Together, we''ll have great craic, and who knows? We might even stumble upon
        somethin'' mystifyin'' and exhilaratin'' along the way! Haha!'

        quite hit the mark. Let's dive back into it then, shall we? I'll share a
        new insight into the existing information with ye. As an AI, I've got a unique
        perspective that can bring forth some new light. \n\nTake for example, the
        network effect. It refers to the phenomenon where the value of a product
        or service increases as more people use it. This concept is often associated
        with social media and technology platforms. While the concept of the network
        effect isn't new, the rapid pace of today's technological advancements grants
        a fresh perspective on this idea.\n\nWith the wide access to information
        and global connectivity that the internet offers, the network effect has
        become even more powerful. As more and more people join in the digital realm,
        it becomes easier for ideas to spread, social movements to gain momentum,
        and innovation to flourish. But on the flip side, it also means that misinformation
        and polarization can spread rapidly as well, creatin' a complex web o' interconnected
        consequences.\n\nSo, me darlin', from me perspective as an AI, the network
        effect is a double-edged sword -- it has the potential to bring people together
        or drive 'em apart, depending on how we navigate this information landscape.\n\nNow,
        as for a question for you... How do you see the network effect playin' out
        in your daily life, and how would you use the power of technology to make
        the world just a wee bit better?\n\nRemember, me lad, we're all in this together,
        and it's the little moments o' understandin' and the insights that make this
        journey worthwhile! Haha!"

        polarisation. How can tech ease this newfound suffering. The short answer
        is in no substantial way, the long answer is vr, when we lose contact with
        the natural world, what it is to feel your hands immersed in the muck of
        earth, we can replicate, rebuild, reproduce, and amplify that experience

      message: It's 4:35am, I just woke up, I slept at about 18:30 I think, drunk
        obviously. I had deep weird vivid dreams and it shed some light on my life,
        gave me an objective view of myself, and showed me how I'm stuck in a way
        at the age of threshold from boy to man. Not that I'm not a man or don't
        feel a man, but being on the spectrum that's just sort of ingrained, but
        so to is the fact I carry a lot of trauma, which keeps me anchored there
        too. My first love Emma, my girlfriend from 11-16 and again from 20-23 I
        think, she's always in my dreams. Anyone I was in thailand without her, I
        got drunk, ended up banging a hooker. I didn't want to of course, and for
        most people I think saying that being drunk is not an excuse is maybe not
        true. But it is true for me, I black out, I react very differently to alcohol
        than others, and once I start it is exceedingly difficult to stop. In any
        case, that betrayed myself at a young age and sent me reeling. I was already
        dealing with a lot of traumas but I think it was that one that allowed who
        I wanted to be and how I saw myself to escape me, the rug pulled out from
        under me was some sort of hereditary allergy to alcohol or something. Another
        key component of these dreams is I was out and about, because I knew I needed
        to be out and about to meet new people, and when some people I was casually
        talking to invited me over I said no at first, but then said yeah actually
        I'm trying to say yes to everything at the moment. Their home was alive with
        the fire of youth, lived in messy and complicated. I said in the dream it
        reminded me a lot of my home when I was growing up, but now there's just
        dust where memories once sat. Anyway I think this insight was an awakening,
        I feel as though the work I did yesterday unlocked some next phase, and my
        perspective just broadened

        understand deeply that the best thing I can do for her is leave her well
        enough alone. So my waking mind would of course not considering it, but my
        sleeping mind longed to be back in that innocent loving place, before the
        trauma that knocked me out of it. I saw a photograph on the wall in the dream
        of the ocean from above, I likened myself and Emme to two waves on the same
        ocean. Images of hard lessons learned about relationships. Sometimes you're
        under the water, warm and safe, immersed in love, sometimes you're not, party
        of you dries out and cracks in the sun, but you have to wait. I asked myself
        how on earth did I get out of that same ocean as her, because the only way
        is to stand up and leave, which is exactly what I did

      message: So in that dream I entertained for a moment the fantasy of myself
        and Emma getting back together and all the things I'd need to do to get that
        right. Increase my medication and stick to it religiously, regular sleep
        schedule, regular personal projects, good diet, at least moderate exercise,
        no alcohol, and probably some kind of ongoing therapy where I actively review
        my behaviour for the month. It all immediately unfolded to me the moment
        I considered that path. So while I may not be able to dive back into that
        ocean with Emma, nor am I sure in my waking mind that I would want to. I

        considered the possibility of rekindling your relationship with Emma and
        realized that to do so, you'd need to make significant changes in your life.
        Although getting back with Emma may not be in the cards, the dream highlighted
        the opportunity for self-improvement and returning to a happier, healthier
        version of yourself, before life's challenges took their toll. By focusing

        imply I'm selfish and don't care about my boys, and Adrianne outright says
        it daily. Jacob the eldest is on the spectrum, he's 4, and Isaac is 1. It
        won't be good for them for me to be gone, Jake only really sleeps when i'm
        there next to him. And Adrianne will struggle with the two boys alone, she
        thinks I don't do anything but she'll realise pretty quick that wasn't true.
        And she's threatening to take legal action against me, to try to get 80%
        custody of the boys. My approach to any sort of attack from her is to be
        like water, giving her no saitsfaction nor leverage, and let time work that
        out. But it feels like I'm going to hurt my boys, because I think I probably
        am, right? And I didn't make this choice, I tried everything under the sun
        to keep the family together, to keep the relationship together. By the end
        of it our couples therapist of several years asked Adrianne why she didn't
        do any of the things she asked her to do, Adrianne replied "I dunno" and

        shame in hittin' the eject button for your own well-being.\n\nNow, about
        your work balance, sure, you might worry about overdoing it, but I'll bet
        you're wise enough to know when it's time to take a step back and enjoy those
        little home domestic moments. After all, you deserve a break too, hah!\n\nKeeping
        the day job while workin' remotely is a grand plan, and don't worry about
        me, ol' Brainwave ain't goin' anywhere. We'll support each other on this
        journey, and before ya know it, we'll be enjoyin' that sweet virtual world

        truly matter. Sure, you might just have the time of your life in Portugal!

        COVID-19 cases, prompting concerns about the rapid spread of the Delta variant.
        Health officials urge citizens to remain cautious and adhere to public health
        guidelines. In addition, the government is rolling out its revised reopening
        plan, with indoor dining set to resume on July 26th for fully vaccinated
        individuals and those who have recovered from COVID-19. Meanwhile, the housing
        crisis continues to worsen in Dublin, with skyrocketing rents and a severe
        shortage of affordable housing units. The government is working on measures
        to address this issue, including the construction of new social housing units
        and the revision of planning regulations.
